## Motivation:
Our group is interested in exploring which factors contribute to the rise of COVID-19 cases in each U.S. state. We are particularly interested in 1) whether there is a difference in COVID-19 cases for states by political affiliation, 2) whether we can classify a stateâ€™s political affiliation using state metadata and COVID-19 cases, and 3) whether there is a difference in the number of new COVID-19 cases based on travel frequencies. 

To explore these questions, we will use datasets on COVID-19 cases, trips traveled by and metadata of each U.S. state to conduct hypothesis testing and classification methods. And to ensure consistency across our datasets, we will use a common time frame from 2020/01/01 to 2020/12/31.
