# COVID-19 Analysis using Hypothesis Testing and Classification Models
This project explores which factors contribute to the rise of COVID-19 cases in each U.S. state. I am particularly interested in the following:
1. Is there a difference in the number of COVID-19 cases in states by political affiliation?
2. Can classify a stateâ€™s political affiliation using state metadata and the number of COVID-19 cases?
3. Is there a difference in the number of COVID-19 cases based on travel frequencies?

To explore these questions, I will use datasets on COVID-19 cases, trips traveled by and metadata of each U.S. state to conduct hypothesis testing and classification methods. And to ensure consistency across the datasets, I will only use data in the following time frame: 2020/01/01 ~ 2020/12/31.
